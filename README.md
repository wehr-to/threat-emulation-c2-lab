# 🧪 Threat Emulation & C2 Design Lab

## 🎯 Purpose
Simulate command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, data exfiltration, and detection pipelines to demonstrate deep knowledge of adversary behavior and blue team response.

## 🛠️ Components

### 🖥️ Simulated C2
- Beacon server (HTTP, DNS)
- Multi-stage payload dropper
- Slack webhook abuse for covert exfil

### 🚨 Detection Hooks
- YARA rules for known beacon strings
- Suricata signature for beacon interval traffic
- eBPF logic to watch for strange outbound traffic

### 📤 Exfil Techniques
- DNS tunneling
- HTTPS POST exfiltration
- Slack webhook abuse
- Encoding techniques to bypass filters

### 🎯 Use Cases
- Red team simulation
- Detection engineering sandbox
- Threat-informed defense training

- T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer
- T1095: Non-Application Layer Protocol

## ✅ To Do
- [ ] Add ICMP covert channel
- [ ] Build GUI for staging payloads
- [ ] Add behavioral detection tuning guide
